# CIFSPH: Coupling Incompressibility Fine Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

Coupling Incompressibility Fine Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (CIFSPH), a more efficient algorithm for incompressible fluid simulation, which is comparable with the existing methods on the computational accuracy.

The algorithm is implemented by C++ and CUDA C++ for the part of GPU parallel accelerated computing.
